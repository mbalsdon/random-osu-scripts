-- 50 at a time: https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/#get-users


- what are the most common beatmaps in players' top100? mods? mappers?
--- look at each players' top100 and increment every time you see a beatmap / mod combination / mapper / etc.

- pp spread in top 100 vs. rank
--- for each xaxis entry (rank) we have a vertical "spread"; pp of 100th play & pp of 1st play

- peak rank vs. current rank

- (the classic) pp vs. rank

- join date distribution (bar chart with each month)

- something with badges

- user id vs join date

- how many players last seen within a month, a week, etc
